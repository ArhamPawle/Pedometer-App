# Pedometer-App

Have created a pedometer app for my Sensor Network lab. The Sensor zip file contains code which makes the use of the sensors of your phone to measure the number of steps. These number of steps are being passed through Google Firebase . The WN zip file contains code for the 2nd second which displays the value of the steps measured by the Sensor app and are displayed in WN app via Google Firebase.
